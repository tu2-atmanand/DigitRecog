# Digit Recognitioin

This is a simple Application made to learn and develope digit recognition using Machine Learning.


## How to use
### To directly use the model:
1. Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Run Python App.py

### To train yourself:
1. Open the Train.ipynb notebook in google colab or jupyter notebook and run the script.

TODO : 
1. Improve the UI
2. Train on bigger dataset for higher accuracy
3. Make the canvas bigger to detect the digits writter continuously on the canvas
4. Take the project further for character recognition from English Alphabets.
