# Digit Recognitioin

This is a simple Application made to learn and develope digit recognition using Machine Learning.


## How to use
1. Run pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2. Run Python main.py



TODO : 
1. Improve the UI
2. Train on bigger dataset for higher accuracy
3. Make the canvas bigger to detect the digits writter continuously on the canvas
4. Take the project further for character recognition from English Alphabets.
